            <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Chang (you can call me Jon). I am currently a senior at UCLA studying Electrical Engineering, but seeking a career in software engineering or data science.</p>
            <p>We are fortunate to be in an age where we have the technology to process almost unlimited information, and so many of the solutions to the problems in the world are staring right at us like an enormous mural of Where's Waldo?</p>

            <p>I am fascinated with finding solutions that will have a real effect on people's lives. I revel in the challenge and love learning to use new tools to further that task. I am creative in that I'm not afraid to imagine steps to a distant future, but I am also detail oriented, so that the path remains on the ground and in clear sight.</p>

                    <p class="code-text"><img class="icon" src="img/code.svg" alt="code icon"> Ruby, Sinatra, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, RSpec, HTML, CSS, FLStudio (music production), Photoshop</p>
                    <p>Le Pendu is a hangman game built on top of Sinatra for Ruby. The name is French for "Hanged Man", borrowed from the title of the picture used as the main background, drawn by Albert Besnard in 1873. I used elements of this picture for a slight plot twist on the original hangman. In this game, the player is a witch trying to remember a spell to prevent a criminal from escaping the hanging.</p>
                    <p>The project focuses on a full stack, from Sinatra to Javascript, rounding out with design work and music production. Capybara/RSpec was very useful for ironing out game logic. It is important that any sound must be expected by the player, so the game begins muted. The controls must persist across all pages and HTTP requests. Also, the music cannot be interrupted by the POST requests used by the guesses. Therefore, the game uses AJAX to send JSON strings to Sinatra to bypass the rendering. </p>
                    <p>The second problem, then, is limiting the features dependent on Javascript so that the game could be played even without it. Therefore, careful considerations were necessary to make sure the default HTML elements were functional even without Javascript. Using JQuery to handle keypress events, then sending them with AJAX is more aesthetically pleasing than typing in a textbox and submitting a form. Of course, players on a mobile phone cannot type without a focus for the onscreen keyboard, so the textbox needs to be visible and in the right place when the screen gets too small.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the music of the game was produced using FLStudio and looped using Audacity. Please note that the plot of the game is somewhat thematically dark, although there are no explicit imagery. It is hosted on a free Heroku dyno for now, but I might move it to an AWS EC2 micro if it's too slow. </p>

                        Advanced continues to the second half of Agile Development, covering more TDD and BDD and Ruby on Rails (one project was to write a feature of a blogging backend that merges blog entries, and is only visible to the admin), code smells, security vulnerabilities, design patterns, and topped off with some Javascript. This part was lighter than the first, perhaps because I'm used to the structure, but leaves plenty of breadcrumbs for future study. I've bought several of the books on the recommended reading list, such as The Mythical Man-Month and Design Patterns by the Gang of Four.

                        This ties The Analytics Edge for my favorite MOOC. What it covers is simply eye-opening, from the everything-is-an-object design of Ruby, to first class functions and blocks, to metaprogramming. And then without a break, it jumps to SaaS (Software as a Service) apps, Ruby on Rails, TDD with RSpec, BDD with Cucumber, Agile, Scrums... and everything connects in a way that I retain the ideas and am motivated to start my own projects based on those ideas. As I understand it, this course has the same content as the first half of Berkeley's live CS169 Software Engineering course, minus the midterms and the final project. By that, I mean all the homeworks are the same and the pacing is the same. And it seems that Berkeley students submit their assignments through the same autograder on EdX. If so, then I wouldn't be surprised, since this course was intense, and I loved it! It was tough balancing it on top of my UCLA course load, but I can say that what I learned here wasn't inferior to what I learned from the live classes.

                        The first of a series of courses centered on Java, this course enumerates, again, the first-year type computer science courses, except it has a particular focus on JUnit testing. And since I have come to appreciate TDD through the other Ruby course, I took this as a review for Java, and to expand my TDD vocabulary.

                        This was one of my favorite courses since it was supremely practical. It dove right into case studies, from the Framingham Hospital study, to baseball predictions ala Moneyball, to presidential election predictions and Supreme Court rulings, and natural language processing and sentiment analysis of Twitter. It used all these to illustrate how to use R to clean, analyze, predict, and graph data. It covered regression, support vector machines, trees, k-nearest neighbor and clustering, and optimization with Excel. The final project was a Kaggle competition. This course solidified my interest in data science and gave me the confidence to seek out more knowledge and tools in that domain.

                        Perhaps a sequel of Andrew Ng's seminal Machine Learning course, this series of courses dives more into the details of deep neural networks, with updates from the industry since.

Yes, it's actually a series of courses, and I took 3/5, but individually, it could be said that they're rather light on content, so it wouldn't make too much sense to have 3 separate listings.

                        This was the course by Coursera's founder Andrew Ng that put Coursera on the map. It was also, I consider, my first "real" introduction into machine learning and data science. The course was more foundational than practical. Instead of diving into case studies and how to solve real problems like The Analytics Edge, it goes over basic vector math behind some of the popular techniques and algorithms in machine learning, such as intuition on what linear and logistic regression does, and how that leads into deep neural network, and what normalization and gradient descent does. And it does this by implementing all of these algorithms in Octave, a free version of MATLAB. It's a whole lot of reinventing the wheel, and thankfully! Machine learning algorithms are not black boxes that perform magic behind the scenes. They make sense!

                        Although the course name seemed to imply that it would plumb the depths of scikit-learn and numpy, this course actually didn't cover much of machine learning techniques, but the statistical foundations, with a quick intro project to the random walk and the Monte Carlo. It's goal was less on data science, and more of exposing how to think in a Pythonic way through some more practical applications. It was quite a new approach compared to the typical write-a-menu-to-order-icecream type projects in a traditional course, and I quite enjoyed it.

                        This was my introduction to Python, and about the time I started to fall in love with the idea of MOOCs. I am greatly interested in developing this decentralized education idea, similar to the inverted classroom, but more like an inverted university, where students learn at home but attend communal discussions with the professor. I see this as a much more sustainable and scalable system of education, but I digress. The course was somewhat like a first-year computer science course, but in Python. At the time that I took it, I had only exposure to C++ at Mt. SAC community college, and limited prior exposure to Java and Basic. Python was confusing at first, but it quickly grew on me.

In its own context, it just made sense. When I came to UCLA, I was expecting to take classes that cover all this content, but to my surprise, while I got bits and pieces in various classes, there are no classes here that offer just combinational MOS logic and digital structures. In retrospect, this course ties together a variety of subjects, and was a surprisingly detailed introductory course.

                        The course was super math and theory heavy, and I admit I didn't catch all of it. I had a little bit of deja vu when I later took UCLA's EE141 Intro to Feedback, which was generally the same topic, albeit with a different focus. To be sure, EE141 went much further into modeling different kinds of systems, the root locus, and controllability. Control of Mobile Robots covered more of the state space approach, with matrices, simplifying calculation but at the expense of making it harder to see conceptually. I plan to review this, but my interests have gradually shifted from control to A.I.

                        This was one of the first MOOCs I completed. It is essentially the lab portion of one of Berkeley's lower divs. I would soon learn the course material at Mt. SAC community college and later, at UCLA, but at the time I was attracted to the hands-on aspect of the course. The course project uses an MSP430 TI Launchpad programmed with Arduino sketches, and pieced together by some basic electronic components. It was a robot that jumped, beeped, and responded to light and sound. For a Mt. SAC engineering class project, I would later build an amplifier hooked up to a drywall speakerbox with a plastic window and lights that changed colors to the music, based off various online schematics and pieced together with some creativity, but the jumpy robot was the first sort-of electrical engineering project I did. This actually drove my interest in robotics for a while, which led me to joining the robotics team at Mt. SAC.
