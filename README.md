# Personal Site

A basic site hosted at http://jonchang.org, which will serve as a launchpad to other projects and contain resume and other background info. The site is just front-end for now, although I plan to add a back-end to it when there is more information to manage.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap 4 beta](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) - The css framework used
* [jQuery 3.2.1](http://api.jquery.com/) - Javascript library

## TODO

* Add falling Tetris blocks in the sky on top of my courses in the "Education" section.
* Fix some projects and upload
* Write a better intro statement

## Authors

* **Jonathan Chang** - *Initial work* - [jachang820](https://github.com/jachang820)

## Acknowledgments

* Used the Seigaiha css pattern hosted at http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/
